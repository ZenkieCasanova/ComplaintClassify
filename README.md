# Customer Service Complaint Classifer

I developed a Customer Service Complaint Classifier using an RNN LSTM model trained on a comprehensive dataset of 22,000 words and titles. With an impressive accuracy rate of 93%, the classifier successfully detects and categorizes customer complaints into subjects such as credit card issues, credit reporting, debt collection, mortgages and loans, and retail banking. By automating the complaint classification process, this project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning and my commitment to improving customer support efficiency and satisfaction.
